OpenTechSchool
==============
We, a group of Python coaches, would like to spread the joy of programming with Python. So we decided to give programming introductions as well as workshops on niche topics.  We've run the Python for beginners workshop in different ities and venues successfully, and have a set of different curricula prepared for your local OpenTechSchool chapter, or for home learning.
