**Have you ever wanted to learn the basics of programming?** Then join us for a weekend of playful coding! A friendly group of Berlin programmers are excited about sharing their joy of programming with you.

We have prepared a hands-on workshop for learning programming using JavaScript, the language that powers the web.

We speak GERMAN and/or ENGLISH.

**What you need:** Bring your laptop (or let
us know you need one) and a curiosity about
programming and how web sites work. The entire
weekend is free. All welcome.
